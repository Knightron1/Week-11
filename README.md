JavaScript Data Structure stores:
Data Structures are specific methods to store and organize data in a computer so that we can access and modify it efficiently. More accurately, it is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations we can apply to the data. 

The different types can be grouped into three different catagories, namely 'Array-like' (Stacks and Queues), Nodes (Linked-Lists, Trees and Graphs), and finally Hash Functions (Hash Tables).

Stack - A stack is an ordered list which follows LIFO (last in first out) algorithm. You can access the elements of a stack from only a single end, called top. 

Queue - A queue is another type of ordered list which follows FIFO (first in first out) algorithm. It has two ends, front (elements added) and rear (elements removed).

Linked List -  a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

Tree - A JavaScript tree is a special data structure that implements the hierarchical tree structure with a root node, child and parent nodes and leaf nodes represented as a set of linked nodes. A tree data structure is a collection of nodes, starting with a root node, with data values in each of the nodes along with the reference to the child nodes. 

Graph - A graph is a group of a finite number of vertices and edges that connect these vertices. The edges can be ‘directed’ (directed graph) and ‘undirected’ (undirected graph). Unlike trees, who maintain a parent-child relationship between their nodes (vertices), the nodes of the graph maintain a complex relationship among them.

Hash Table - Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.
