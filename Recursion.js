// Intro to Recursion
/*Recursion is a technique for iterating over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result.
*/
// Advantages and Disadvantages of JS recursion
/* Advantages - 
   Recursion is more elegant and requires a lesser number of variables which makes the program short and clean.
   Recursion can be made to replace complex nesting codes since we donâ€™t have to call the program, again and again, to do the same task as it calls itself.
*/
/* Disadvantages - 
    Recursion uses more memory.
    Recursion can be slow.

// Real World Examples
/* A Matryoshka doll, or Russian Nesting doll, is a great real example of recursion, each doll containing a small doll within until its finally too small to do so.
